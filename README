## Features
* Implements Salesforce best practices of 1 trigger per object & logicless triggers
* The abstract class TriggerHandler.cls handles determining the current context and calling 1 of 7 protected methods - triggers only have to call the public execute() method
* Provides recursion detection/prevention by checking the list of trigger records have already been processed
* Allows triggers to be enabled/disabled both globally and individually at the org, profile and user levels (hierarchy custom setting)
* Allows framework debug statements to be enabled/disabled
* Recursion prevention: in the event that there is a recursive loop, each handler detects that it has already processed the records and skips duplicated execution


### Example Implementation: LeadTriggerHandler.cls
